# CS50-Chores
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
Final project for CS50 which uses HTML, JS, Netlify Functions (aka AWS Lambda) and remote DB 

Main feautures:

1. Used technology stack:
  - HTML (for main page, like Single Page Application)
  - CSS (custom and provided by Bootstrap)
  - JavaScript (for main logic) 

2. User-friendly interface
  - Layout adopted for desktop and mobile view
  - Identification realized by Netlify Identity

3. Remote DB
  - Postgre-based remote database - Supabase
  - CRUD functions by Supabase queries

Main idea.
  This is a new look on the classic TO-DO app. When you or anybody want to add some task for everyone who you want - just open a page, register in the system, and add new task. Add description to your task which explains what to do, choose executor and save it. After that everyone can see these tasks and complete them. When task will be done - close it or delete it under creators's account. You can edit your task if you remember something important and decide to add it to the task dscription.
  You might prefer work on the desktop site, but also you might use tablet, laptop or mobile phone to manage tasks. Just add task during a day, and check then in yhe evening from any device which you use.

Main HTML file contains:
  - Menu for desktop and mobile versions
  - Authorization section provided by Netlify Identification module for better security

Main Javascript file contains:
  - function for create HTML layout for jobs in DB
  - Create/Read/Update/Delete functions to interacte with 'jobs'

CSS file contains:
  - custom CSS styles for visual design of page and elements
